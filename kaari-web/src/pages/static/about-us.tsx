        <p>
          Kaari was founded in 2023 with a simple mission: to make renting properties in Africa as easy, transparent, and safe as possible. We saw the challenges that both tenants and property owners faced in the traditional rental market and set out to create a platform that addresses these issues head-on.

          Our team consists of real estate professionals, technology experts, and customer service specialists who are passionate about improving the rental experience for everyone involved.
